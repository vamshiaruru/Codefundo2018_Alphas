# Codefundo++, Microsoft, 2018. Team Alphas.
This repository is meant to maintain the code from Team Alpha for the Codefundo++ 2018 hackathon.
The main challenge of this hackathon is to help reduce the number of lives and property lost in the event of a natural calamity. 

## Our idea

We wish to make a website that acts as a central managing point for myriad activities and act as a dashboard for rescue efforts. 
Some of the features we wish to include are:
* Ability for Social workers/ volunteers to add a location in need of help
* Ability to join a group that has already started working on an existing location
* Keep track of resources available and resources required at each location in the affected area and distribute them, both manpower and resources.
* Act as a dashboard and display information - such as priority levels of various places, the identities of people who have been rescued, lost and missing persons etc.,
* Possibly integrate a deep-learning powered prediction model
* People in need can raise an SOS and the volunteers shall be assigned to them.
* Ability to donate resources
* A custom blog mainted by people with certain previligies to post information about the ongoing disaster.
* and many more..
